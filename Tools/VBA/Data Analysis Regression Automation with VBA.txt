Running a regression in Excel using its Data Analysis toolkit is not ideal compared to alternative options, but if required for 
the task it is possible to 'automate' parts of it using macros in VBA. 

You will need to use a macro-enabled Excel file and have the developer tab visable. You can access the VBA window directly in 
Windows by pressing ALT+F11. You will want to create a regression with the following structure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub Regression()
    Application.RUN "ATPVBAEN.XLAM!Regress", ActiveSheet.Range("<ENTER RANGE OF DEPENDENT VARIABLE>") _
    , ActiveSheet.Range("<ENTER RANGE OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLE>"), False, True, , "", False, False, _
    False, False, , False
    ActiveSheet.Name = "<ENTER NAME TO ASSAIGN TAB>"
    Worksheets("<ENTER TAB WHERE YOUR DATASET IS LOCATED>").Activate
End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get this code to work you will need to make sure that the Data Analysis for VBA toolkit is activated in your Excel 
add-ins. You will want to run this code when looking at your dataset tab so it selects the correct fields from the correct tab.
If you chose not to do this, then you will need to add in the last line of the subcode to the top so it switches to the dataset
as the active tab. In the second line of the subcode, there exist one "True" element. This represents the first row of the
dataset being associated with a title. The remaining items would have to be researched further to accomidate different needs.
